<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Built using the [Official Bitburner Typescript Template](https://github.com/bitburner-official/typescript-template)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

1. Install Packages
    - `npm i`
2. Run typescript compiler
    - `npm run transpile`
    - Will watch for file changes and output js files to dist
3. Open another terminal, run bitburner remote-api server
    - `npm run watch`
4. Connect to remote API in game
    - `Bitburner -> Options -> Remote API -> Connect`

## Todo

1. Continuous batching
    - Currently batching only occurs in the first `hacktime` duration, then stops as we can't start jobs reliably while others are completing

See the [open issues](https://github.com/github_username/repo_name/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
